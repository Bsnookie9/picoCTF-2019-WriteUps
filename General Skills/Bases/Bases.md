# Description
What does this `bDNhcm5fdGgzX3IwcDM1` mean? I think it has something to do with bases.

# Hints
Submit your answer in our flag format. For example, if your answer was 'hello', you would submit 'picoCTF{hello}' as the flag.

# Solution
Take the ciphertext and decode it using `From Base64` with CyberChef

Now take this decoded text `l3arn_th3_r0p35` and format the flag, as mentioned in the hint. Flag: `picoCTF{l3arn_th3_r0p35}`
