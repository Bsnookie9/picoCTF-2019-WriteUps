# Description
If I told you a word started with 0x70 in hexadecimal, what would it start with in ASCII?

# Hints
Submit your answer in our flag format. For example, if your answer was 'hello', you would submit 'picoCTF{hello}' as the flag.

# Solution
Use a [HEX to ASCII](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-ascii.html) converter to solve this problem. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use ASCII/UTF-8

Enter 0x70 into the hex and you get 'p' as the string:
