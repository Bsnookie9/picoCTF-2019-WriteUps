# Hints
Hmm it doesn't seem to check anyone's password, except for Joe's?

# Solution
Enter the first linked provided into a browser of choice

The hint mentions that password checking is only used for Joe's account. Let's try a random username and password

We see that we have logged in but cannot obtain the flag that way

Use `ctrl` + `shft` + `i` to inspect the page. Click on the `Application` tab. Then click on `Cookies` and then the jupiter link

We can see here that the website stores three cookies upon logging in: 

- a username string
- a password string
- an admin boolean (default set to False

If we change that value to True, we can manipulate the server into thinking that we are an admin, and login to the site.

After editing the admin boolean to True. Refresh the page and you'll be presented with the flag!
