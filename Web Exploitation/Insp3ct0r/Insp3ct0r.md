Tags: `Easy` `Web Exploitation` `picoCTF 2019`

# Description
Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection: 
https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/9670/ or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:9670

# Hints
- How do you inspect web code on a browser?
- There's 3 parts

# Solutions
Enter the first link provided into a browser of choice

When the page first loads, you are prompted with the "What" tab which is that the site designer made a website. GREAT!

When you click on the "How" tab, you see that the site was created using HTML, CSS, and JS (JavaScript)

This goes hand in hand with the hint that there are three parts. Let's inspect the site

Use `ctrl` + `shft` + `i` to inspect the site

Click the `Application` tab to inspect the frames

Move down to the `Frames` tab on the left hand side

Opening each tab, you'll see CSS (mycss.css), JavaScript (myjs.js), and 9670/ (HTML), each with its own part that together makes the flag.
