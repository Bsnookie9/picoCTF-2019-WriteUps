# Hints
What is obfuscation?

# Solution
Using the hint, we can assume that the flag will be obfuscated. 

> [!TIP]
> Obfuscation is the action of making something obscure, unclear, or unintelligible.

The title of this challenge is similar to a previous challenge. Let's inspect the web site and see what we can find. Use `ctrl` + `shft` + `i`

Now we can hit the drop down to see the body of the site and the main script. Here we can see that the flag is chopped up

Additionally, obfuscation is somewhat visible here with pieces of the flag showing an attempt at being obfuscated. 

Concatenate the pieces together and enter it into the password and you get prompted with Password Verified:
