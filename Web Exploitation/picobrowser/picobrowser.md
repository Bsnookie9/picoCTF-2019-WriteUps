# Hints
You don't need to download a new web browser

# Solution
When first opening the page, we are presented with a big green button that says flag on it

After clicking, we are prompted with an error:

If we reference the description, it mentions that the site can only be rendered using picobrowser

Using the hint as well we can see that we don't need a different browser. The error that we received is a user agent error,
mentioning that we aren't picobrowser. We can change the user agent using inspection mode.

Use `ctrl` + `shift` + `i` to enter inspection mode. Next click the three vertical dots next to the gear icon in the top right.
In the drop down menu select "More tools" and then "Network conditions":

Expand the Network conditions box at the bottom where you can see "User agent". Here you  can uncheck `Use default browser` and
enter in the custom box `picobrowser`:

Then click the green flag button again and you will be presented with the flag:
