# Description
There is a website running at https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/52849/. 

Someone has bypassed the login before, and now it's being strengthened. 

Try to see if you can still login! or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:52849

# Hints
- The password is being filtered

# Solution
This is similar to Irish-Name-Repo 2, with the only difference that the password is now being filtered.

The SQL injection having the username as `' OR 1=1--` and the password as whatever does not work as we get an SQLi error:

We can take a wild guess and say that the username is most likely admin, so we can set the username to `admin'--`

Next we can continue with the rest of the previous SQL query for the password. 

We want to remove the `AND password=''` part, preventing the password from being checked


> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Username: `admin'--`  
> Password: `SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username='admin'--`

Our query then bypasses the password check, letting us through the portal and being presented with the flag
