Tags: `Easy` `Web Exploitation` `picoCTF 2019`

# Description
Can you find the robots? https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/36474/ or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:36474

# Hint
What part of the website could tell you where the creator doesn't want you to look?

# Solution
Enter the first link provided in a browser of choice

After the site loads, you see:

```
Welcome

Where are the robots?
```

The hint mentions where the creator doesn't want you to look. I wasn't sure what robots had to do with a website so I searched `web exploitation and robots`

I found an article from [PortSwigger](https://portswigger.net/kb/issues/00600600_robots-txt-file) that mentioned a `robots.txt` file

Robots.txt is a file that essentially instructs web robots about locations within a web site that are allowed, not allowed, etc.

I tried adding robots.txt to the end of the link provided, I was taken to a page that provided a not allowed html file:

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /477ce.html
```

I then replaced robots.txt with the disallowed HTML. Here I found the flag!

Flag: `picoCTF{ca1cu1at1ng_Mach1n3s_477ce}`
