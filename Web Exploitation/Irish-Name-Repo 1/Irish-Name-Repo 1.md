# Overview

# Description
There is a website running at https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/33850/ or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:33850 

Do you think you can log us in? Try to see if you can login!

# Hints
- There doesn't seem to be many ways to interact with this. I wonder if the users are kept in a database?
- Try to think about how the website verifies your login.

# Solution
When opening this site, we can see the content on the main page is not very helpful. Clicking the hamburger stack in the top left give options 

The Support page shows a few inquiries, one even mentioning an SQL error. This tells us that the site uses a SQL database. 

If we go to the Admin Login, we can try a basic SQL Injection to bypass the portal. 

The common SQL injection is specifically having the username as `' OR 1=1--` and the password as whatever. 

How SQL databases verify logins is from an SQL query that might look something like this:

```sql
SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username='$username' AND password='$password';
```

If we put in our injection for the username, the query becomes:

```sql
SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username='' OR 1=1--' AND password='';
```

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Username: `' OR 1=1--`  
> Password: `SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username='' OR 1=1--' AND password='';`

This query essentially checks if the username is equal to nothing. Then, it checks OR 1=1. 

With 1 always being equal to 1, this returns true. The `--` at the end simply comments out the rest of the query. 

Our query then tricks the server into letting us through the portal and being presented with the flag
