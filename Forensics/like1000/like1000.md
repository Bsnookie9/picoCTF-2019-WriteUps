Here is where a script would be helpful. Let's use this script:

```
#! /bin/bash

cp 1000.tar out
cd out
for((i = 1000; i > 0; i--));
do
  if [ ! -f "$i.tar" ];
  then
    break
  fi
  tar -xvf $i.tar
done
cd ..
```

First create the `out` directory before running this script

After running this you'll get the `flag.png` file. Open that file and you'll see the flag:

Flag: `picoCTF{l0t5_0f_TAR5}`
